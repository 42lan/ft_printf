# ft_printf
Implementation of my own printf function in C because I’m tired of using ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr()

### Introduction
Regardless of the programming language considered, the **printf** function, (or its equiv-alents) is always highly useful.
The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers.
Some variations even propose to be able to write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor
or in a particular stream. Some also propose to recall this string without printing it.

In short, undeniably, **printf** is a vital function. In this project, I asked to recode it and add it to my **libft** so that
I can use it in all my future projects, such as **ft_ls**..

It was a chance for me to discover a feature of the C language – *variadic functions* – and to practice
detailed management of the printing options.
